3 parts: 1) Bloom Filter, 2)Flajolet-Martin algorithm, 3)AMS algorithm

#### Part1: Bloom Filter

* Have branch, bloom_filter.

* Installed nltk and bitarray.

* implemented and tested universal hash function.

* Bloom filter made and timed
   * Takes < 200 seconds

* Data stream checked against filter and timed.
    * Takes ~ 30 seconds
    
Total number of word collsion: 66350

Number of words in Proper.txt: 32657

Number of false positives: 33693

False positive rate: 33693/66350 = 0.508
